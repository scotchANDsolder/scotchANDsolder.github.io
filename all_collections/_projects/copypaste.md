Space is not just physical but also virtual. This is an intervention where I aim to disrupt the virtual and physical.

In this intervention I copied WiFi signals from my studio and replayed them in a structure made out of EMF blocking fabric. Upon entering the structure visitor are prompted to open Google Maps. Upon doing so their smartphones are transported to my studio, even though they are physical standing in the gallery.
